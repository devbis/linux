title: QCOM IOMMU for APQ8064

maintainers:
  - Will Deacon <will@kernel.org>

description: |
  The MSM IOMMU is an implementation compatible with the ARM VMSA short
  descriptor page tables. It provides address translation for bus masters outside
  of the CPU, each connected to the IOMMU through a port called micro-TLB.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: qcom,apq8064-iommu

  interrupts:
    description: |
      Specifiers for the MMU fault interrupts. For instances that
      support secure mode two interrupts must be specified, for non-secure and
      secure mode, in that order. For instances that don't support secure mode a
      single interrupt must be specified.

  iommus:
    description: |
      A reference to the IOMMU in multiple cells. The first cell is a
      phandle to the IOMMU and the second cell is the stream id.
      A single master device can be connected to more than one iommu
      and multiple contexts in each of the iommu. So multiple entries
      are required to list all the iommus and the stream ids that the
      master is connected to.

  "#iommu-cells":
    const: 1
    description: |
      The number of cells needed to specify the stream id.
